            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Prince Louis Rwagasore, born in 1932, was an iconic Burundian leader and 
                a staunch advocate for his country's independence. As the founder of the Union 
                for National Progress (UPRONA), he played a significant role in the fight against
                 colonization and the unification of Burundi. Unfortunately, his life was tragically 
                 cut short in 1961 when he was assassinated just days before the elections that could have
                  made him the Prime Minister of an independent Burundi. His legacy continues 
                to inspire future generations to strive for freedom, justice, and national unity.</p>
